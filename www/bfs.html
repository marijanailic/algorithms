            <p>Breadth-first search is a simple strategy in which the root node is expanded first, then all the successors of the
            root node are expanded next. then their sucessor and so on In general, all the nodes are expanded at a given
            depth in the search tree before any nodes at the next level are extended</p> <p>Breadth-first search is an istance
        of the general graph-search algorithm in which the
        <i>shallowest</i> unexpanded node is chosen for expansion. This is achieved very simple by using FIFO queue for the
        frontier. Thus, new nodes (which are always deeper than their parents) go to the back of the queue, and old nodes,
        which are shallower than the new nodes, get expanded first</p>
        <p>Goal test is applied to each node when it is generated rather than when it is selected for expansion. Also, algorithm
            discards any new path to a state already in a frontier or explored set. Such path must be at least as deep as
            the one already found. Thus, BFS always has teh shallowest path to every node on the frontier.</p>
