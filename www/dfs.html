        <p>Depth-first search always expands the deepest node in the current frontier of the search tree. The search proceeds
            immediatly to the deepest level of the search tree, where the nodes have no successors. As those nodes are espanded,
            they are dropped from the fronteer, so then the search "backs up" to the next deepest node that still has inexplored
            successors.
        </p>
        <p> The depth-first search algorithm uses LIFO queue whereas breadth-first search uses FIFO queue. A LIFO queue means
            that the most recently node is chosen for expansion. This must be the deepest unexpanded node because is one
            deeper than its parent - which in turn, was the deepest unexpanded node when it was selected.</p>
        <p>As an alternative to the graph-search style implementation, it is common to implement depth first search with recursive
            function that calls itself on each of its children in turn.</p>
